# Data Science and Machine Learning (HUA)

This repository containing assignments from various subjects related to Data Science and Machine Learning that I participated in, during my time as an undergraduate student at Harokopio University of Athens.

## Subjects Included

1. **Data Mining** - 7th Semester
2. **Machine Learning** - 7th Semester
3. **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** - 7th Semester
4. **Graph Technologies** - 7th Semester
5. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - 6th Semester

## Overview

Each subject folder contains a README file providing details about the assignments within. Here's what you can expect to find in each folder:

- **Code:** Python code files for implementing algorithms and analyses.
- **Reports:** Detailed reports describing the assignment results, methodologies used, and findings. Please note that these reports were originally written in Greek and then translated automatically into English using [this tool](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/).

## Other Assignments

During my time as a student at HUA, I also attended other subjects related to data science. The projects for these subjects can be found in GitHub repositories on my profile. Some examples include:

- [Music Recommender](https://github.com/manouslinard/music-recommender): Explores topics such as full-stack application development, web scraping, and genetic algorithms for recommending music to users.
- [Smart City App](https://github.com/manouslinard/smart-city-app): Features data visualization capabilities.
- [Hackathon Driver](https://github.com/manouslinard/hackathon-driver-distr): Utilizes OpenCV for detecting drowsy drivers.


Feel free to explore each folder to learn more about the specific assignments and the work done for each one.
