# Machine Learning Assignments (HUA):

This folder contains all the machine learning projects completed for the course 'Machine Learning & Applications' at Harokopio University of Athens. Each project received the highest possible score, with grades ranging from **10/10** to **13/10** (with bonuses). Below, you'll find a brief summary for each project located in their respective folders.

## Assignments Overview

### 1st Assignment: Linear Regression on California Housing Dataset
- **Score:** 10/10 (max score: 10)
- **Description:** Implemented and tested a simple linear regression model in Python for predicting housing prices using the California Housing Dataset.

### 2nd Assignment: Skin Lesion Classification using CNN
- **Score:** 13/10 (+3 bonus, max score: 13)
- **Description:** Automated classification of skin lesions using CNNs implemented with PyTorch. The dataset includes 10,000 dermoscopy images labeled with 7 skin diseases.

### 3rd Assignment: GPT-2 Model Training & Experimentation
- **Score:** 12/10 (+2 bonus, max score: 12)
- **Description:** Experimented with GPT-2 generative model using a smaller model with 124 million parameters. Fine-tuned the model on the Star Wars subtitles dataset to explore its language generation capabilities.

## Deliverables

Deliverables for each project include Python code and a report, with translations from Greek to English. **The reports were first written in Greek, then translated automatically into English (using this [tool](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/)).**
