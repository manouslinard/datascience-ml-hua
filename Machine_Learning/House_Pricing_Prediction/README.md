# Linear Regression on California Housing Dataset

## Overview

This project aims to implement and test a simple version of a linear regression model in Python for predicting housing prices. Predicting housing prices is crucial for various real estate applications, including investment decisions and market analysis.

## Application to the California Housing Dataset

### Data Preparation

The California Housing Dataset is used for this project. You can find a description of the dataset [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/california-housing-data-description). Additionally, the dataset is available through sklearn.datasets (refer to the documentation to find the function you need to call to download and load the dataset).

## Deliverables

For the submission of the assignment, the following deliverables were provided:

1. **Custom Linear Regression Model**: Implemented in `linear_regression.py`, this file contains the code for creating a custom linear regression model.

2. **Testing Script**: The testing of the linear regression model was conducted using `test_lr.py`.

3. **Results Report**: A report was prepared to describe the outcomes of the experiments.

## Results Report

I have prepared a comprehensive report documenting the results of the experiments. The report includes visualizations such as plots and charts for better understanding and interpretation of the outcomes. **The report was first written in Greek, then translated automatically into English (using this [tool](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/)).**
