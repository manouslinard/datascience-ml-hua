# Automated Skin Lesion Classification

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system for automated classification of skin lesions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with PyTorch. It utilizes both self-implemented networks trained from scratch and pre-trained networks for feature extraction, employing transfer learning techniques.

## Motivation
Skin lesion classification through dermoscopy images plays a crucial role in diagnosing skin diseases, including skin cancer. Automating this process can offer several benefits such as easy monitoring and detection of lesions associated with high risk for skin cancer, tele-dermatology diagnosis, and supporting dermatologists in achieving more accurate diagnoses.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the research work [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03368), comprising approximately 10,000 dermoscopy images collected from two organizations in Austria and Australia. The images are labeled with annotations corresponding to 7 different skin diseases:

* MEL: Melanoma
* NV: Nevi
* BCC: Basal cell carcinoma
* AKIEC: Actinic keratosis
* BKL: Benign keratosis
* DF: Dermatofibroma
* VASC: Vascular lesion

## Results Report
I have prepared a comprehensive report documenting the results of the experiments. The report includes visualizations such as plots and charts for better understanding and interpretation of the outcomes. **The report was first written in Greek, then translated automatically into English (using this [tool](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/)).**
