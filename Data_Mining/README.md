# Data Mining Assignment (HUA): Predicting Oscar Winners in Hollywood Movies:

This folder contains a group project I participated in for the subject "Data Mining" (in Harokopio University of Athens). This assignment got a **100/100** grade.

## Project Overview

In the context of the Data Mining assignment for 2023-2024, we were tasked with analyzing a dataset containing Hollywood movies released from 2007 to 2018. Our goal was to predict whether a movie will win an Oscar award, while ensuring to avoid overfitting and utilizing clustering techniques to group movies with common characteristics. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of clustering in separating Oscar-winning movies from others. The tasks involved preparing the data, training a classifier, and assessing its performance on known and unknown data samples. Finally, we documented our methodology and analysis for submission.

## Tasks

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the dataset containing Hollywood movies released from 2007 to 2018.
   
2. **Clustering Analysis**: Utilize clustering techniques to group movies with common characteristics, focusing on separating Oscar-winning movies from others.
   
3. **Classifier Training**: Train a classifier to predict whether a movie will win an Oscar award, ensuring to avoid overfitting.
   
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the classifier on known and unknown data samples, evaluating its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   
5. **Documentation**: Document your methodology, including data preprocessing steps, clustering techniques, classifier training approach, and performance evaluation metrics. Provide insights into the analysis and discuss any challenges encountered.

## Deliverables

- Python code for data preprocessing, clustering, classifier training, and performance evaluation.
- A report documenting the methodology, analysis, and results. The report is comprehensive and well-structured, providing clear explanations and visualizations where necessary. Also, **the report was first written in Greek, then translated automatically into English (using this [tool](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/)).**
