# Graph Technologies Assignment (HUA)

This folder contains a group project I participated in for the subject "Graph Technologies & Applications" at Harokopio University of Athens. This assignment received a score of **10/10**.

The goal of this project is to familiarize students with algorithms for computing node embeddings in graphs. The assignment implements **graph factorization** and specifically mentions using an algorithm described by Ahmed et al. [1](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40839.pdf) and implementing it using Python and the NetworkX library.

## Task Description
The task involves calculating vectors Z for each node in a non-directed graph, where these vectors aid in determining the existence of edges between nodes. We were required to develop code that computes these vectors, test the algorithm on real-world graphs, and create small graph examples for testing purposes and inclusion in the report. Additionally, we were asked to explore applications of this technique, implement one of them, provide detailed documentation on how to run the code, and submit a report explaining our work, code, and showcasing execution examples.

## Deliverables
The deliverables include Python code and a detailed report explaining the results. **The report was first written in Greek, then translated automatically into English (using this [tool](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/)).**
