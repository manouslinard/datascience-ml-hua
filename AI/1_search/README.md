# 1st Assignment - Search Algorithms

**This exercise can be found in Berkeley's official Artificial Intelligence course [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)**. Here follows the task instructions for the exercise **as they are** from the official Berkeley website:

## Overview
In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

### Autograder
As in Project 0, this project includes an autograder for you to grade your answers on your machine. This can be run with the command:

```
python autograder.py
```

See the autograder tutorial in Project 0 for more information about using the autograder.
