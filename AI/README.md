# Artificial Intelligence Assignments (HUA)

This folder contains all the AI assignments done for the subject "Artificial Intelligence" (of Harokopio University of Athens), in which I achieved a **10/10** score.

The assignments are based on the Pacman projects developed at the University of Berkeley (http://ai.berkeley.edu) as educational tools for the Artificial Intelligence algorithms.

**The reports of the assignments were first written in Greek, then translated automatically into English (using this [tool](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/)).**

## Setting Up Your Environment

First, install Anaconda (or Miniconda) for Python3 from the following website:
- Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
- Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Next, create a conda environment with Python version 3.6 as follows:

```
conda create --name your_env_name python=3.6
```
You can choose any name for your environment; here, we used "your_env_name".

Then, activate the environment with the command:


```
conda activate your_env_name
```

To deactivate the environment, you can execute the command:
```
conda deactivate
```

## How To Run
Finally, to test the code, go to the corresponding `code` directory and run the `autograder.py` provided (in the directory). This will automatically give you a score of the corresponding exercises to be checked.

For more information on how to run the `autograder.py`, check the `README.md` in the corresponding `code` directory.
