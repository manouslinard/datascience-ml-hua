# 2nd Assignment - Minimax and Expectimax Algorithms

**This exercise can be found in Berkeley's official Artificial Intelligence course [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html)**. Here follows the task instructions for the exercise **as they are** from the official Berkeley website:

## Overview

In this project, you will design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, you will implement both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design.

## Autograder
As in project 1, this project includes an autograder for you to grade your answers on your machine. This can be run on all questions with the command:

```
python autograder.py
```
It can be run for one particular question, such as q2, by:

```
python autograder.py -q q2
```

By default, the autograder displays graphics with the -t option, but doesn't with the -q option. You can force graphics by using the --graphics flag, or force no graphics by using the --no-graphics flag.
