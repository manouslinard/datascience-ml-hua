# Explainable Artifical Intelligence (XAI) Assignment (HUA):
 
This folder contains a group project I participated in for the subject "Human-Computer Interaction" (in Harokopio University of Athens). This assignment got **10/10** grade. Each of the exercises of this project focuses on predicting specific outcomes or understanding patterns within the datasets. Below are short descriptions of each exercise:

## Project 1: Wine Quality Prediction
Description: Analyze the methods of interpretable artificial intelligence in predicting wine quality using the 'Wine Quality' dataset. Implement a linear regression model in Python.

## Project 2: Bank Marketing Analysis
Description: Analyze the 'Bank marketing' dataset to predict client subscription to a banking product based on variables like age and job.

## Project 3: Heart Disease Prediction
Description: Utilize the 'Heart disease' dataset to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. Train a regression model using SHAP and XGBoost libraries for explanations.

## Project 4: Housing Dataset Analysis
Description: Work with a dataset containing various variables related to housing. Perform analysis or modeling tasks on this dataset.

## Project 5: Feature Importance Comparison
Description: Calculate conditional expectation plots for specific features, evaluate feature importance metrics, and compare the results obtained in previous sections.

## Deliverables
The project's deliverables include a comprehensive report that explains the results of the machine learning models using interpretability (XAI) techniques such as SHAP-values, LIME, etc. Additionally, code was developed to implement these XAI techniques, and it is included in this folder for reference. **The report was first written in Greek, then translated automatically into English (using this [tool](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/)).**
